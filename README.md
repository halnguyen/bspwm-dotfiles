<h1>BSPWM dotfiles for Arch Linux</h1>
Since Arch Linux comes with just the terminal out of the box, this is just a backup of personal system/settings/etc.. for future conveniency (All them scripts took quite a bit of time reseaching and writing). Use at our own risks.
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
Tiling window manager for the win!!!<br>
For this environent, I'm using:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a> for tiling window mananger</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd">sxhkd</a> manages keybindings</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar">Polybar</a> for the status bar</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">NeoVim</a> as a text editor (you don't exit vim, <strong>vim exit you</strong>)</li>
	<li>Display manager <a href="https://github.com/canonical/lightdm">LightDM</a> handles GUI login and wallpaper</li>
	<li>Along with soooo many other things, refer to dependencies.txt for a full list of all things running in the system (this is currently on my TODO:)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Todo:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Restructure files in the PC branch.</li>
	<li>Write an install script for PC systems.</li>
	<li>List out all dependencies in a .txt file for both branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
